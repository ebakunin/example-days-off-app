The employee already has several days off scheduled. By clicking dates on the calendar you can add or remove as many as 365 days off at a time.",
    "UI_EXPLANATION_2": "The app is fully mobile responsive. It supports multiple languages and can switch on the fly. Because this is a demonstration, all default data is mocked and does not communicate with an API. CRUD actions do work as expected but are lost if the page is refreshed.",
    "UI_EXPLANATION_3": "The codebase is built on Angular 12. The calendar is a heavily customized version of a PrimeNG component. Other PrimeNG UI components are used as well. The bare bones CSS framework is based on Skeleton. The app codebase is available on GitHub.",
    "UI_EXPLANATION_4": "The app is based on my code from a previous job. It is somewhat over-engineered to show off various technologies. If you have any questions, suggestions, or (horror) find a bug feel free to message me."
